# Go course (beginner)

This course is an introduction to Go for people
who already have some programming experience.

The course material consists of slides,
some of which contain editable and executable code samples.
You can run the slideshow on your machine after following a few simple steps:

1. If you haven't already installed Go on your machine, do so by
    following the official [installation instructions][install].

2. Important: make sure that the directory where Go installs binaries
    is in your `PATH` environment variable.
    The directory in question is usually given by the following command:

    ```shell
    echo `go env GOPATH`/bin
    ```

3. Install the [`present`][present] tool:

    ```shell
    go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present@latest
    ```

4. Clone this repository and `cd` to the clone:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/jub0bs/go-course-beginner
    cd go-course-beginner
    ```

5. Run the present tool:

    ```shell
    present
    ```

    The output should contain some local URL (like `http://127.0.0.1:3999`).

6. Visit the URL from step 5 in your browser,
    then click on `main.slide` to start the slideshow.

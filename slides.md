### Go's history

* created at Google in 2009
* ...by Rob Pike, Robert Griesemer, Ken Thompson
* Go 1.0 released in 2012
* Go 1.13.4 (latest release)
* powers Docker, Kubernetes, and many more

---

### What makes Golang special

* syntax reminiscent of C
* strong typing
* fast compilation
* garbage collector (fast & easy to tune)
* pointers, but no pointer arithmetic

---

### What makes Golang special (cont'd)

* first-class functions

* no operator overloading
* no generics

---

### What makes Go's ecosystem special

* BSD licence
* an agenda of simplicity
* no centralised package repository
* rich standard library
* rich command-line interface (gofmt!)
* vibrant community

---

### Why learn Go now

* built-in concurrency

* dependency management (finally) solved
* good serverless support (AWS, GCP, Azure)

---

### Go playground

* https://play.golang.org
* de facto online REPL
* automatic imports
* automatic formatting
* permalinks

---

### Go playground limitations

* a single, main package
* no networking
* no command-line arguments
* only standard-library imports
* concurrency is weird...

---

# First steps in Go

---

### [Hello, World!](https://play.golang.org/p/xY2BPIIxBbk)

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

---

### Hello, World!

* all source files start with a package clause
* `main` package: defines an executable program
* `main` function: program's entrypoint
* import-declaration syntax
* no semicolons needed to terminate statements

---

### Building & running a Go program

* `$ go build main.go`
* `$ go run main.go`

---

### Keywords

```txt
break       default       func      interface   select
case        defer         go        map         struct
chan        else          goto      package     switch
const       fallthrough   if        range       type
continue    for           import    return      var
```

---

### Predeclared names

* Constants
```txt
false true nil iota
```
* Types (more about that later)
* Built-in functions
```txt
make    len     cap     new
append  copy    delete
complex real    imag
panic   recover
```

---

### Comments

* end-of-line comments:

```go
var foo = "foo" // this is a comment
```

* multiline comments (do not nest)

```go
/*
  this is
  a multiline comment
*/
```

---

## Imports

---

### Package path

* globally unique
* examples
  * `fmt`
  * `io/ioutil`
  * `github.com/jubobs/username/twitter`

---

### Default package name

* the last component of the package path
* examples
  * `fmt`
  * `ioutil`
  * `twitter`
* picking a different name is possible
```go
import tw "github.com/jubobs/username/twitter"
```

---

### Import block

* possible to factor multiple import declarations

```go
import (
  "encoding/json"
  "fmt"
  "import io"
)
```

---

### Elements of style: import order

```go
import (
  // standard-library packages
  //
  // 3rd-party packages
  //
  // your packages
)
```

---

### The `fmt` package

* `fmt.Println`
* `fmt.Sprintf`
* `fmt.Printf`

---

### Elements of style

* source files in UTF-8
* indentation: tabs, not spaces

---

# Variables

A variable is an _addressable value_.

---

## Variable declaration

```go
var <name> <type> = <expression>
```

* type is optional...
* initialising expression is optional...
* ...but not both!

---

### Variable blocks

possible to factor multiple `var` declarations

```go
var (
	legalRegexp   = "^[A-Za-z0-9]*$"
	illegalPattern = "--"
)
```

---

### Elements of style: variable naming

* strive for conciseness
* camel case (no underscores)
* the smaller the scope, the shorter the name

---

### Short variable declaration

```go
<name> := <expression>
```

* type is inferred from expression
* there must be new values on the left-hand side!
* unused declared variable => compilation error!
* use the _blank identifier_ (`_`) when needed
* shadowing (due to lexical scoping) can lead to bugs

---

### Initial value

* no uninitialised variable in Go!
* implicitly assigned the _zero value_ of its type
```go
var i int
fmt.Printf("value: %d\n", i) // "0"
```

---

### `var` or `:=`

* `:=` only allowed for local variables
* favour `var` over `:=` when
  * the initial value must be the zero value
  * the initial value doesn't matter


---

# Basic types

---

### Booleans

* type `bool`
* values: `false` or `true`
* zero value: `false`
* not: `!`
* and: `&&`
* or: `||`

---

### Signed integers

* `int` (size is platform-dependent)
* `int8`
* `int16`
* `int32` (a.k.a. `rune`)
* `int64`

---

### Unsigned integers

* `uint` (size is platform-dependent)
* `uint8` (a.k.a. `byte`)
* `uint16`
* `uint32`
* `uint64`
* `uintptr` (size is platform-dependent)

---

### Floating-point numbers

* `float32`
* `float64`
* `complex64`
* `complex128`

---

### Numeric operators

* arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
* comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
* bitwise (integers): `&`, `|`, `^`, `&^`

---

### Increment/decrement statements

* only work with integer types
* increment `i` by 1: `i++`
* decrement `i` by 1: `i--`
* no prefix inc/dec operators
* `i++` is a statement, not an expression!

---

### Runes

* `rune` is an alias for `int32`
* represents a single Unicode code point
* UTF-8 encoding (1 to 4 bytes per rune)
* number of bytes in rune `r`: `utf8.RuneLen(r)`

---

### Rune literals

* delimited by single quotes: `'a'`, `'æ±‰'`
* some escape sequences:
  * `'\n'`
  * `'\uhhhh'`
  * `'\Uhhhhhhhh'`

---

### Strings

* immutable data structure
* under the hood
    * a pointer to an array of bytes
    * an int corresponding to the length
* zero value: empty string
* concatenation operator: `+`

---

### String literals

* delimited by double quotes...

```go
s := "Hello World!"
```

* ...or backticks (_raw string_)

```go
`json:"Name"`
```

---

### Useful packages for string manipulation

* `strings`
* `unicode/utf8`
* `strconv`
* `regexp`

---

### String length

```go
s := "Hello, World!"
len(s)                    // number of bytes
utf8.RuneCountInString(s) // number of runes
```

---

### Indexing a string

* 0-based indexing
* `s[i]` is the `i+1`th byte in string `s`
* if `i` out of bounds, _panic_!

---

### Substring operator

* syntax: `s[lo:hi]`
* semi-open interval: bytes from index `lo` to index `hi` (exclusive)
* structural sharing between string and its substrings
* if _hi_ or _lo_ out of bounds or _hi < lo_, panic!

---

### Substring operator (cont'd)

`lo` and `hi` are optional
* `s[:hi]` is equivalent to `s[0:hi]`
* `s[lo:]` is equivalent to `s[lo:len(s)]`
* `s[:]` is equivalent to `s`

---

### Ranging over a string

* iterates over the _runes_ of a string
```
for i, r := range s {
 ...
}
```
* exercise: print each rune and its index

---

### Named types

```go
type <name> <underlying_type>
```

* underlying type can be arbitrary
* user-defined types
* `type` declaration
* _methods_ can be defined on named types!

---

### Conversion

* strong typing
* no implicit casting in Go
* (almost) all conversions must be explicit

---

### Constants

* values fixed at compile time
* `const <name> = <expression>`
* no function calls allowed on right-hand side
* allow optimisations by the compiler
* two categories of constants: typed and untyped


---

### Typed constants

```go
const Monday int = 1
```

---

### Untyped constants

* constants not committed to a particular type
* flexibility!
* six _kinds_ of untyped constants
* numeric untyped constants have at least 256 bits of precision
* [example from the `math` package](https://golang.org/pkg/math/#pkg-constants)

---

### Constant blocks

possible to factor multiple const declarations

```go
const (
  Un = 1
  Deux = 2
  Trois = 3
)
```

---

### `iota` constant generator

* syntactic sugar for creating numeric constants

```go
const (
  Un = iota + 1
  Deux
  Trois
)
```

* RHS expression is implicitly reused within the constant block
* `iota` evaluates to `0`, then `1`, then `2`, etc.

---

### Enum pattern

* no native enumeration types
* instead, named type based on `int`
* not very typesafe
* exercise: write a `Month` enum

---

### Enum pattern: example

```go
type Month int
const (
  _ Month = iota
  January
  February
  //...
  December
)
```

---

## Pointers

* a value that holds the address of a variable
* `*T` denotes the type of a pointer to a variable of type `T`
* zero value: `nil`

---

## Pointers (cont'd)

* `&`: address-of operator
* `*`: dereference operator
* `nil` dereference: panic!

---

# Basic control-flow structures

---

### `if` (basic form)
```go
if <condition> {
  <body>
}
```
* condition is of boolean type
* no parentheses around condition
* braces are mandatory

---

### `if` (with optional declarations)
```go
if [short-var-declarations;] <condition> {
  <body>
}
```
* variables scoped to the `if` statement
* examples in Go playground

---

### `if`/`else`
```go
if <condition> {
  <if-body>
} else {
  <else-body>
}
```
* `else` is seldom used in Go
* avoid long `if`/`else` chains

---

### `switch`

```go
switch <condition> {
case <expression>:
  ...
case <expression>:
  ...
...
default:
  ...
}
```
exercise: write a signum function

---

### `switch`

* cases are evaluated from top to bottom
* the first match is executed
* if none match, the (optional) default case is executed
* `default` can occur at any place among the cases

---

### Tagless `switch`

```
switch {
case <condition>:
  ...
case <condition>:
  ...
...
default:
  ...
}
```
* favour a tagless switch to `if`/`else` chains

---

### `for` loop

```
for <condition> {
  <body>
}
```
* no `while` in Go

---

### `for` infinite loop

```
for {
  <body>
}
```

---

### C-style `for` loop

```
for <init>; <condition>; <post> {
  <body>
}
```

---

### `range`-based `for` loop

```
for <variables> := range <data-structure> {
  <body>
}
```
* `range` works with
  * strings
  * arrays
  * slices
  * maps
  * channels

---

# Functions

---

## Function declaration

```
func <name>(<param-list>) <result-list> {
  <body>
}
```

---

### Multiple results

```
func CountWords(path string) (int, error) {
  // ...
}
```

---

### Named results

```
func CountWords(path string) (c int, err error) {
  // ...
}
```
* useful for
  * clarifying the roles of results
  * simplifying some implementations

---

### Type factorisation

```
func first(a, b int) int {
  return a
}
```

---

### Function call

* no default parameter value
* no optional parameters
* all arguments must be specified

---

### Parameter evaluation

* call-by-value evaluation
* However...
  * Some types are glorified pointers (e.g. strings).
  * These types are known as "reference types".

---

### Functions are first-class values

* a function can be
    * another function's parameter
    * another function's result
* function literals

---

### Recursion

* functions can call themselves
* exercise: mutually recursive functions
    * `isEven(uint) bool`
    * `isOdd(uint) bool`

---

### Closures

* functions can capture variables in their environment
* exercise: stateful function

---

### Project: validating the length of a Twitter username

* `isLongEnough(username string) bool`
* `isShortEnough(username string) bool`

---

# Error handling & reporting

---

### Signaling a failure to the caller

* a function that can fail returns an additional value
* this value comes last, by convention
* only one possible cause: `bool`
* multiple possible causes: `error` (an interface type)
* non-nil error: something bad happened

---

### Error-check idiom

```
if err := fou(); err != nil {
  // unhappy path :(
  // early return
}
// happy path
```
* convention: keep the happy path "on the left"
* (not nested in if-else statements)

---

### Beyond `err != nil`

* you might want to find out more about the nature of the error
* when possible, assert on the error's behaviour
* more on that later (when we know what interfaces are)

---

### Error handling

* always check for errors
* when appropriate, wrap errors in custom errors before reporting them
* few errors should be ignored

---

## Project: validating legal chars/patterns

* `containsOnlyLegalChars(username string) ???`
* `containsNoIllegalPattern(username string) ???`

---

## Project: validate a prospective Twitter username

* `isValid(username string) bool`

---

# Packages

---

# Unit testing

---

### `testing` package

* tests for package `foo` should be written in `foo_test.go`
* `foo_test.go` must be placed inside folder `foo`
* the package declaration of `foo_test.go` matters:
    * `import foo`: white-box testing
    * `import foo_test`: black-box testing
* test methods start with prefix "Test" (e.g. `TestValidity`)
* Run `go test ./...` at the root of your module

---

### Code coverage
```
go test -coverprofile="coverprofile.tmp" ./...
go tool cover --html="coverprofile.tmp"
```

---

# Composite types

---

## Arrays

---

### Arrays

* fixed-length container of elements of the same type
* elements are contiguous in memory
* length is encoded in the array type (e.g. `[3]int`)
* zero value: array full of zero values of the element type

---

### Array literals
```
words := [3]string{"foo", "bar", "baz"}
moreWords := [...]string { // specify the size is optional
  "qux",
  "quux", // the last comma is mandatory
}
```

---

### Operations on array

* indexing  (same as for strings)
* array elements are variables: `&arr[i]` is legal
* get a slice from an array: `words[:]`
* `copy(dst, src)`
* ranging over an array
```
for i, v := range arr {
  // ...
}
```

---

### Array are no reference types

* functions with array params get a full copy of them!
* for this reason, arrays are seldom used directly in Go

---

## Slices

---

### Slices

* fundamental, ubiquitous type in Go
* a resizable view inside an array
* a slice of `T` has type `[]T`

---

### Slices: under the hood

* a slice is composed of
  * a pointer to an array (inaccessible)
  * a length (`len`)
  * a capacity (`cap`): the size of the underlying array

---

### Slice is a reference type

* zero value: `nil`
* a function with a slice parameter gets a copy of it
* but the underlying array is not copied!

---

### Allocating a slice

* `s := make([]string, l)` // l: length
* `s := make([]string, l, c)` // c: capacity

---

### Slice literal

```
words := []string{"foo", "bar", "baz"}
moreWords := []string {
  "qux",
  "quux", // the last comma is mandatory
}
```

---

### Indexing into a slice

* same syntax as for strings
* indexing into a `nil` slice: panic!
* slice elements are variables: `&s[i]` is legal

---

### Slicing operator

* `s1 := s[i:j]`
* if `j` exceeds `cap(s)`, panic!
* yields a different view into the same array
* also: `s1 := s[i:j:k]` gives you more control over the resulting slice's capacity

---

### Ranging over a slice

```
for i, v := range s {
  // ...
}
```

---

### Appending an element to a slice

* use the built-in function `append`
* `s = append(s, elem)`
* built-in `append` copies elements to a larger underlying array if capacity has been reached

---

### Appending another slice to a slice

* `s = append(s, s1...)`

---

### Aliasing

* multiple slices may use the same underlying array
* careful...

---

## Maps

---

### Maps

* collection of key-value pairs
* a map of `T`s to `U`s has type `map[T]U`
* the key type must be comparable
* implemented as a hash table

---

### Maps are reference types

* zero value: `nil`
* a function that takes a map argument gets a copy of the reference
* the underlying hash table does not get copied

---

### Allocating a map

```
m := make([string]int)
```

---

### Map literals

```
enToFr := map[string]string {
  "one": "un",
  "two": "deux",
  "three": "trois", // mandatory comma
}
```

---

### Accessing the elements of a map

* `v := m[k]`
* key `k` need not be in the map
* ... in which case `v` will be the zero value for the value type!

---

### Testing for membership

* `v := m[k] // then test that v is not the zero value?`

---

### Testing for membership

* `v := m[k] // then test that v is not the zero value?`
* no! (ambiguous)
```
v, ok := m[k]
if ok {
  // the key is present
}
```

---

### Ranging over a map
```
for k, v := range m {
  // ...
}
```
* iteration order is nondeterministic!
* if iteration order matters, first create a slice of sorted keys

---

### Sets

* No native set type in Go!
* Usually implement as `map[T]bool`
* ... or `map[T]struct{}`

---

## Structs

* Go playground

---

# Methods

---

# Interfaces

---

### Interfaces

* abstract type
* describes a type that has certain methods
* an interface is composed of
  * the name of a concrete type
  * a pointer to a value of that type
* THE mechanism for polymorphism in Go

---

### Interfaces are reference types

* zero value: `nil`
* an interface that holds a `nil` pointer to a concrete type is not itself `nil`!
* pointers to interfaces? rarely (if ever) useful

---

### Interface satisfaction

* verified at compile time
* implicit!
* compare to Java
```
class PokerHand implements Comparable<? super PokerHand>
```
* methods on the concrete type using a pointer receiver

---

### Interfaces as contracts

* some interfaces ask implementors more than satisfying a signature
* example: [`io.Reader`](https://golang.org/pkg/io/#Reader)
* not enforcible by the compiler!
* => write tests to check that the implementor is lawful!

---

### Keep interfaces small

* favour one-method interfaces
* many examples in the standard library
* naming convention for single-method interfaces: method + "er"
```
type Climber interface {
    Climb(int)
}
```
* easier to satisfy

---

## Notable interface examples

---

### The empty interface

* `interface{}`
* satisfied by _any_ type
* useful in some cases
```
go doc fmt.Println
```
* but not very typesafe
* avoid, if possible

---

### `Stringer` interface

```
type Stringer interface {
  String() string
}
```
* governs how `fmt` functions print values of a concrete type

---

### `error` interface

```
type error interface {
  Error() string
}
```
* `go doc errors`

---

### `Wrapper` interface

```
type Wrapper interface {
  // Unwrap returns the next error in the error chain.
  // If there is no next error, Unwrap returns nil.
  Unwrap() error
}
```
* useful for error-translation idiom
* i.e. creating high-level errors that refer to the underlying cause
* experimental in Go 1.12
* to be added to standard package `errors` in Go 1.13

---

### `Reader` interface

```
type Reader interface {
  Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
```
* source of `[]byte`
* satisfied by `*os.File`, and many others

---

### `Writer` interface

```
type Writer interface {
  Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
```
* sink of `[]byte`
* satisfied by `*os.File`, and many others

---

### Favour interface parameters

* if possible, take interface types as function parameters, rather than concrete types
* example
```
type Tree struct {...}
func (t *Tree) Save(f *os.File) error
```

---

### Favour interface parameters

* if possible, take interface types as function parameters, rather than concrete types
* example
```
type Tree struct {...}
func (t *Tree) Save(w io.Writer) error
```
* more flexible
* easier to test!

---

### Require no more, promise no less

* only ask for the required behaviour from interface parameters
```
func (f *Foo) Save(rw ReadWriter) error
```

---

### Require no more, promise no less

* only ask for the required behaviour from interface parameters
```
func (f *Foo) Save(w Writer) error // better!
```
* similar to DDD principle of "keeping ports small"

---

### Interface composition

```
type ReadWriteCloser interface {
  Reader
  Writer
  Closer
}
```
* small interfaces are convenient for composition!

---

### Asserting on behaviour

```
func isTimeout(err error) bool {
    type timeout interface {
        Timeout() bool
    }
    te, ok := err.(timeout)
    return ok && te.Timeout()
}
```
* if `err` satisfies interface `timeout`
  * `te` has type `timeout`
  * `ok` is `true`

---

### Type switch

```
func do(i interface{}) {
  switch v := i.(type) { // what's the type of i?
  case int:
    //...
  case string:
    //...
  default:
    fmt.Printf("I don't know about type %T!\n", v)
  }
}
```

* creates a strong dependence on the concrete types
* avoid type switches on types you don't own

---

### Mechanics of the `defer` keyword

* delays a function call to when the enclosing function terminates
* ... whether normally or not (panic)
* the arguments of the deferred function call are evaluated at the `defer` statement!
* `defer` statements are executed in reverse order in which they appear in the enclosing function

---

### `defer` is useful for cleaning up resources

```
func IsAvailable(username string) (bool, error) {
  resp, err := http.Get("https://twitter.com/" + username)
  if err != nil {
    return false, errors.New("Unknown availability")
  }
  if resp.StatusCode != http.StatusNotFound {
    resp.Body.Close() // <--- reclaim resource no longer needed
    return false, nil
  }
  resp.Body.Close() // <--- needed here too!
  return true, nil
}
```

---

### `defer` is useful for cleaning up resources

```
func IsAvailable(username string) (bool, error) {
  resp, err := http.Get("https://twitter.com/" + username)
  if err != nil {
    return false, errors.New("Unknown availability")
  }
  defer resp.Body.Close() // <--- once and for all!
  if resp.StatusCode != http.StatusNotFound {
    return false, nil
  }
  return true, nil
}
```

---

### Gotcha: using `defer` in a loop

* Can you spot the problem?

```
func foo() {
  for i := range ... {
    r, err := obtainResource(i)
    if err != nil {
      // deal with error
    }
    defer r.Close()
    // do something with r...
  }
}
```

---

### Gotcha: using `defer` in a loop

* this can lead to resource exhaustion
* favour

```
func foo() {
  for i := range is {
    if err := process(i); err != nil {
      // deal with error
    }
  }
}
func process(i int) error {
  r, err := obtainResource(i)
  if err != nil {
    // deal with error
  }
  defer r.Close()
  // do something with r...
}
```

---

### Gotcha: errors in deferred function calls

* Deferred statements return no result.
* What if the function call returns an error?

```
func foo() error {
  // ...
  defer badIfThisFails() // but any error occuring here is lost!
  // ...
}
```

---

### Gotcha: errors in deferred function calls

* workaround: use a named return and a func literal

```
func foo() (err error) {
  // ...
  defer func() {

# Concurrency

---

### Concurrency

* the art of composing a programme in terms of independenly executing computations
* arguably Go's most fascinating aspect
* very important in this era of multicores

---

### Concurrency is not parallelism

* a way of writing a program
* concurrent programme has value even if ultimately executed on a single core

---

### The origin of Go's concurrency

* Tony Hoare's _Communicating Sequential Processes_
* two fundamentals mechanisms:
  * goroutines
  * channels

---

### goroutines

* a concurrent function execution
* an executable's `main` function is itself a goroutine
* you can spawn more goroutines using the `go` keyword
* Go scheduler is in charge of switching between goroutines
* metaphor: a chef and his (her?) assistants in a restaurant kitchen

---

### The `go` keyword

* precede a function call by `go` to spawn a new goroutine
```
go prepareSoufflÃ©()
go peelPotatoes()
```
* golden rule: before launching a goroutine, understand exactly how it will terminate
* exercise

---

### Wait groups

* `main` does not wait for other goroutines to terminate before it itself terminates
* if tempted to use a sleep, step away from the keyboard and think again
* _wait groups_ (`sync.WaitGroup`) can be used for
  * keeping track of the number of executing goroutines
  * waiting for that count to go down to 0

---

### Wait-group example

```
func main() {
  var wg sync.WaitGroup // remark: usable zero value!
  wg.Add(1)             // one more goroutine created
  go func() {
    defer wg.Done()     // one done
    prepareSoufflÃ©()
  }()
  wg.Add(1)             // one more goroutine created
  go func() {
    defer wg.Done()     // one done
    peelPotatoes()
  }()
  wg.Wait()             // ... for all goroutines to be done
}
```

---

### Gotcha: goroutine & function literal

```
func printTenIntsConcurrently() {
  var wg sync.WaitGroup
  for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    wg.Add(1)
    go func() {
      defer wg.Done()
      fmt.Println(i)
    }()
  }
	wg.Wait()
}
```

* what's the problem?

---

### Gotcha: goroutine & function literal

```
func printTenIntsConcurrently() {
  var wg sync.WaitGroup
  for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    wg.Add(1)
    go func(j int) {
      defer wg.Done()
      fmt.Println(j)
    }(i)
  }
	wg.Wait()
}
```

* what changed?

---

### Gotcha: goroutine & function literal

* rule of thumb: avoid using func literals with `go`
* (unless the goroutine needs too much of its environment)
* instead, define a dedicated function

```
func printTenIntsConcurrently() {
  var wg sync.WaitGroup
  for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    wg.Add(1)
    go printConcurrently(i, &wg)
  }
	wg.Wait()
}
func printConcurrently(i int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
  defer wg.Done()
  fmt.Println(i)
}
```

---

### Channels

* _Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating._
* channel: mechanism for passing values of a certain type from one goroutine to another
* a channel of `T`s has type `chan T`
* naming convention: "ch" (alone or as suffix)

---

### Creating channels

* `ch := make(chan T, c)`
* `c`: optional capacity (defaults to zero)
* reference type
* zero value: `nil`

---

### Channel capacity

* a channel has
  * a length: `len(ch)` (seldom used)
  * a capacity: `cap(ch)`
* a channel of
  * zero capacity is called an _unbuffered channel_
  * positive capacity is called a _buffered channel_

---

### Closing a channel

* a (non-`nil`) channel starts its life as open
* a channel can be closed: `close(ch)`
* useful operation when ranging over a channel
* a closed channel cannot be re-opened
* attempting to close a closed channel: panic!

---

### Closing a channel (cont'd)

* closing a channel does not drain it from the elements it contains
* channels are not resources
  * only close them if the program requires it
  * otherwise, simply let them get GC'd

---

### Sending to a channel

* sending value `v` to channel `ch`:
```
ch <- v
```
* different behaviours, depending on the state of `ch`:
  * nil: blocking
  * open
    * not at capacity: adds `v` to `ch`
    * at capacity: blocking
  * closed: panic!

---

### Receiving from a channel

* receiving a value from channel `ch`:
```
<-ch
```
* to store the received value in a variable:
```
v := <-ch
```
* different behaviours, depending on the state of `ch`:
  * nil: blocking
  * not empty: yields an element from `ch`
  * empty:
    * open: blocks
    * closed: yields the zero value of the element type

---

### Dispelling the ambiguity

* If you a receive a zero value from a channel, how do you know whether it's open or closed?
* Like this:
```
v, ok := <-ch
```
* `ok` is
  * true if `ch` was still open at the time of receiving `v` from it
  * false if `ch` is closed

---

### Ranging over a channel

* receiving from a channel in a loop
```
for v := range ch {
  // ...
}
```
* loop only terminates once channel is closed
* exercise

---

### Directional channels

* send-only, receive-only channels
* send-only channel of `T`s has type
```
chan<- T
```
* receive-only channel if `T`s has type
```
<-chan T
```

---

### Directional channels (cont'd)

* useful in function signatures, to restrict channel behaviour
* the compiler disallows
  * receiving from a send-only channel
  * sending to a receive-only channel
  * closing a receive-only channel

---

### `chan struct{}`

* can be useful for signaling that some unambiguous event took place!

```
type empty struct{}
// ...
ch := make(chan struct{})
// ...
ch <- empty{}
```

---

### `select` key word

* analogous to a switch in which the first case that is "ready" gets executed

```
select {
case v := <-ch1:
  // do something with v
case ch2 <- 42:
  // ...
default:
  // ...
}
```

* `default` case
  * is optional
  * executes if none of the other cases is ready
* exercise

---

### Event loop

```
for {
  select {
  case ...:
    // ...
  case ...:
    // ...
  default:
    // ...
  }
}
```

* exercise

---

### Concurrency patterns

* we're only scratching the surface of what's possible
* many, many different possibilities with goroutines and channels
* to get an idea, watch _Go Concurrency Patterns (Rob Pike, Google I/O 2012)_:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6kdp27TYZs

---

### Communicating by sharing memory

* why? for performance reasons
* two alternatives to channels
  * atomics
  * mutexes

---

### Atomics

* synchronized operations on fixed-sized integers
* see `sync/atomic` package
* exercise

---

### Mutexes

* "mutual exclusion"
* allows you to acquire/release a lock on a variable
* see `sync` package

---

### Mutex example: concurrency-safe map

```
var mu sync.Mutex
m := map[string]int
// ...
// inside some goroutine
s := "foo"
mu.Lock()
{
  m[s]++
}
mu.Unlock()
```

* readability tip: enclose the critical section in braces to make it stand out

---

### What we haven't covered

* useful third-party libraries
* concurrency patterns
* profiling
* micro-benchmarks
* escape analysis
* mechanics of the garbage collector
* mechanics of the Go scheduler
* `context` package
* compiler options
